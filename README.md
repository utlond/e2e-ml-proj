# e2e-ml-proj (End-to-end Machine Learning Project - Logistic Regression Classifier)

This is a small end-to-end machine learning project that I carried out in March 2022 that took me about a day to complete. Included in the repo are the 2 csv files that I downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prakharrathi25/banking-dataset-marketing-targets), containing the training and test datasets, together with a Jupyter notebook which contains the scope of the task, the source code, and the outputs produced.
